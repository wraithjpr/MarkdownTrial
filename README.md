# Markdown Trial using Pen

See on [Github here](https://github.com/utatti/pen) by utatti.

> npm install --global pen

Then run the pen command:

> pen README.md

This launches a pen server listening on port 6060 [http://localhost:6060/](http://localhost:6060/). You can also launch pen without a filename and then manually open [http://localhost:6060/README.md](http://localhost:6060/README.md), or other files in the launch directory.
